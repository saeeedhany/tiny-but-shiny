# 🌟 Tiny but Shiny

> Small projects that shine through my eyes ✨

This is a collection of tiny projects that I build for fun and curiosity.
Each one might be small, but it has something special — at least to me.

## 🔧 Project Structure

Each project lives in its own folder or repository.
Every project follows this format:
- 📜 What is it?
- 🤔 Why did I build it?
- 🧠 How does it work?
- 🔨 How to build and run it?

## 📚 Projects

- [🖌️ Paint](./projects/paint.md) — draw on screen with SDL and keyboard.
